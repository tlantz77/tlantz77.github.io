	<article class="bio">
    	<p>Hey all, one of my favorite bands of recent years is <b>Grizzly Bear</b>!  An indie-rock band formed in Brooklyn, New York in 2002, their sound has often been described as <em>chamber pop</em> or <em>neo-psychedelic pop</em>.  A few of my personal favorite songs include "Ready, Able", "Sleeping Ute" and "Half-Gate."</p>  

	    <p>The current band members consist of:
    	<ul>
    		<li>Edward Droste (vocals, keyboards, omnichord)</li>
    		<li>Daniel Rossen (vocals, guitar, keyboards)</li>
    		<li>Chris Taylor (bass, backing vocals)</li>
    		<li>Chris Bear (drums, backing vocals)</li>
    	</ul></p>

    	<h3>Thoughts</h3>
        <p>Looking at <a href="http://grizzlybeargalore.tumblr.com/">grizzlybeargalore.tumblr.com</a> the overall basic structure is pretty understandable to me.  There are a bunch of block elements that I'm unfamiliar with though.  I'm not sure what "iframe" does, although it seems to define the the little "Never miss a post!  Follow" window you see in every tumblr page.  "Script" is heavily used and seems to be a block element for embedding Javascript into the page.  At least every instance seems to be followed by a Javascript function, which I'm a bit familiar with from Codecademy.  I imagine it's primary way you get Javascript to interact w/ HTML.  Other than those two it's mostly div's! They're all obviously used to create the big blocky subdivisions on the page that are common to modern web style that looks good on tablets, phones, etc.</p>
